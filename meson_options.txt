# NOTE: Right now this does not actually require CMake. Because of a limitation
#       in Meson we can't use the original build definitions just yet. For the
#       time being we have just written our own meson.build to replace the SDK's
#       CMake project. Once Meson allows mixing native and cross compiled CMake
#       subprojects the commit that added this notice can be reverted.
